# Hello! üëã

My name is Josef Ondrej and I enjoy building useful mathematical and machine learning models.

I have a solid background in mathematics ‚ûó, particularly in statistics and probability theory, from my studies at
university. But I also certainly do not shy away from scraping data and digging into it and writing well tested ‚úÖ
production code with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring üñ• -- skills that I gained while developing and operating
the [Watson Assistant Autolearn](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autolearn) feature
at IBM.

My language of choice is Python üêç (in which I developed a few small libraries and projects
like [Snax](https://github.com/josefondrej/snax), [Transplants](https://github.com/josefondrej/transplants), [SVGecko](https://github.com/josefondrej/svgecko),
[API-Watchdog](https://github.com/josefondrej/api-watchdog) and [GlucoScan](https://github.com/josefondrej/glucoscan))
but I have also worked a lot with Java and have some experience also with
R, JavaScript, Groovy (for Jenkins plugins), C# and few others.
I can also manage some basic web development (React, HTML, CSS) if needed.

Nowadays, I am actively promoting the use of MLOps at sports ‚öæ betting company [Tipsport](https://www.tipsport.cz/)
mainly using Jenkins, Docker, OpenShift, ArgoCD, MLFlow and Helm Charts while also developing models for predicting
sports matches outcomes in Tensorflow and PyTorch.

In my free time I enjoy climbing and hiking in the mountains ‚õ∫ üèî.
